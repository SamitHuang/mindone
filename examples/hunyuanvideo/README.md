# HunyuanVideo: A Systematic Framework For Large Video Generation Model

Here we provide an efficient MindSpore implementation of [HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo), an open-source project that aims to foster large video generation model.

This repository is built on the models and code released by Tencent HunyuanVideo. We are grateful for their exceptional work and generous contribution to open source.

- HunyuanVideo (Text-to-Video Model)
  - [x] Inference
  - [x] Training (SFT)
  - [ ] LoRA fine-tune
  - [ ] Web Demo (Gradio)
  - [ ] Multi-NPU parallel inference
- HunyuanVideo (Image-to-Video Model)
  - [ ] Training support
  - [ ] Inference

## 3D VAE

### Reconstruction

To run a video reconstruction using the CausalVAE, please use the following command:
```bash
python hyvideo/rec_video.py \
  --video_path input_video.mp4 \
  --rec_path rec.mp4 \
  --height 360 \
  --width 640 \
  --num_frames 33 \
```
The reconstructed video is saved under `./samples/`.


### Evaluation

To evaluate VAE's PNSR, please download MCL_JCV dataset from this [URL](https://mcl.usc.edu/mcl-jcv-dataset/), and place the videos under `datasets/MCL_JCV`.

Now, to run video reconstruction on a video folder, please run:

```bash
python hyvideo/rec_video_folder.py \
  --real_video_dir datasets/MCL_JCV \
  --generated_video_dir datasets/MCL_JCV_generated \
  --height 360 \
  --width 640 \
  --num_frames 33 \
```

Afterwards, you can evaluate the PSNR via:
```bash
bash hyvideo/eval/scripts/cal_psnr.sh
```
