This folder contains code and scripts for diffusion model evaluation, including 

- Fr√©chet inception distance (FID)
- CLIP score
- CLIP directional similarity 

Note that all these metrics are neural network-based thus the parameters used are kept the same as the pytorch version used in other benchmarks.
