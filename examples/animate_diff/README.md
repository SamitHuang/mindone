MS-optimized AnimateDiff

Since torch AD relies heavily on diffusers and transformers, we will build a new code framework.
    1. SD modules are from LDM, base config: ../stable_diffusion_v2/configs/v1-inference.yaml

## Design Rules
1. Build framework. Then get what we want from those sources. 
2. Double check input-output when using existing modules.
3. user-end api, make it as closer to original AD as possible

## TODO: 
1. Code framework 
    - setup code file structure 
    - setup code key API structure
    - config method:
        Need to merge sd_v1_inferernce.yaml with ad_inference_v1.yaml
    
2. Net Modules
    - CLIP-vit l/14 text encoder 
        - API: input config, return clip 
        [ ] transfer from SD 
        [ ] check: padding token! 
    - VAE 
    - UNet 3D
